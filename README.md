Well I certainly learned a lot about OpenGL, a very powerful API. I definitely will be continuing to work on things like this stuff. It was a lot of fun, albeit a bit aggravating at times. I have a new found apprecation for CAD applications and modeling software, like SolidWorks and Blender. The things we take for granted...

The last homework assignment, Assignment 8-3, was probably the most fun, coding collisions. It's a tricky beast trying to program physics, but the pay off is worth it.

My general modus operand is to refactor the crap out of code, to make it more modular and cleaner. The original base code for 8-3 was a bit messy, but I refactored it down to some simple functions that are easier to read and understand, as well providing more intuitive funcationality. As far iterations go, I followed simple practices: make a change, test it.

I think I have a new found passion for graphics now. I think I might pursue a field in related work.
